           <div>  <h2>Pneumatic driven shape-change tnterface by using surface construction</h2> 
           
           <p>Basically, in this exercise, we make a pneumatic construction using the technique of surface interfacing by making a sandwich of two sheets of vinyl thermo-lapped, or thermo-polyurethane, and in the middle an insulating sheet that can be Teflon. However, a cheaper version and made for the projects DIY is the baking paper, this technique is used in the T-shirt printing method using the press for transfer. described in the following presentation: </p>

                <p>The essential rules as that you have to connect all the chambers for the air/ fluid circulation</p>
                
                <ol>
                <li>All the channels must be connected to the entrance of the air and the tube</li>
                <li>Consider in your design the sealing allowance, to isolate well your pnematic </li>
                <li>consider also that some of the thick materials can barely perform thin shapes, in the case for in detail design; please use thin vinyl.</li>
                <li>Remember that a piece must be the mirror shape in the case of asymmetric pieces.</li>
                    
                </ol> 
        
        
                <p>Preheat the heat press depending on the temperature of the vinyl, c.a.120° - 140° C.
                <br>You can use the vinyl cutter to cut delicate pieces that require more precision or natural nice looking. 
                <br>After having the cut of these two feet in need to put the insulating foot between the middle. 
                <br>Make sure that in the middle there is a thin piece of baking paper for the air tube inlet.
                <br>Put two sheets of baking paper or Teflon sheets at the base of the dam and the top. 
                <br>Press the material for 15 seconds. and wait for it to cool down.
                <br>Remove the pieces of protective material gently for the vinyl pieces making sure not to break the vinyl. 
                <br>Insert the tube in the Inflatable and isolate it using a shrink tube and a lighter or heat gun. 
                <br>Proceed to inflate and have fun with your device
